## Basics

To start, the simplest form to show information in the console is with the `console` command:

```javascript
console.log("Hello World!");
```

String (text) can (and should) be written between double quotes, single quotes and backwards quotes, always the same to open and close:

```javascript
console.log("Mensaje 1");
console.log("Mensaje 2");
console.log(`Mensaje 3`);
```

You can compute basic arithmetic operations from `console.log`.

### Variables

The names of variables must be descriptive. The way to name it should be 'lower camel case'.

There are 3 ways of declare variables, with `var`, `let` and `const`.

`var` is the first form to declare variables to be used with the language, it means literally a variable.
